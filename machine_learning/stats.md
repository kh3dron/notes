### Some common statistics knowledge needed for ML

- Bias / Variance tradeoff: underfitting / overfitting problem. You need a middle zone for a good model
- ROC curve: 
  - X axis is false positive rate, Y axis is true positive rate. 
  - ROC curve bends upwards from Y=X, want it to bend higher
  - Perfect classifier is at top left corner (all true positives, no false positives)
- Precision: positive predictive value
- Recall: true positive rate
