The Society of Mind

- 1 - Prologue
    - some terminology:
        - each mind has many smaller processes called agents
        - agents are simple
    - Three rough scales of brain evolution:
        - Short term: maturation of a single brain (through life and learning)
        - Medium term: evolutions of societies (culture, invention)
        - Long term: natural selection (chemistry, anatomy)
    - consider the cell as a unit of life
        - all higher-order organisms appear remarkable compared to the ability of a single cell
    - now, make an equivalent comparison from the basis as one brain as the unit of intelligence 
    - your person is a society of mental subroutines, agents, for different actitons & methods
    - learaned experience gets compressed into "common sense" over time
    - agents are recursive: they are composed of pointers to other, simpler agents
    - __no agent views itself as intelligent, because it knows all it does is maniuplate other agents. In reality, this is the very process of intelligence.__
- 2 - Wholes and Parts
    - The intelligence of an agent is its ability to form logical conections of its subagents - the weights of the neural network
    - no box can hold a mouse: no board can hold a mouse, and a box is only multiple boards
- 3 - Comflict and Compromise
    - play with blocks: build tower or destroy tower?
    - confusion beteween routines manifests confusion within the parent method of play with blocks
    - __The Principle of Noncompromise: the longer a conflict persists amond an agent's subordintaes, the weaker that agent becomes among its own competitors. If this persists, other agents will take control and dismiss the arguing sub-agents.__
    - Heirarchies: "beurocratic" work of organizing subroutines is extremely important
- 4 - The Self
    - can machines have souls? Can machines learn?
    - knowing the purpose of things makes understaanding them easier - that the heart is aa pump, for examaple
    - we ask a similar function for the Self
        - one function of our Self is to help facilitate long term planning via an identity
        - imagination similarly helps planning
        - sometimes there are secondary goals: we can make ourselves less sleepy by imagining a scenario that makes us mad
- 5 - Individuality
    - The recursive problem of knowing the self - who makes our decisions?
    - Fredkin's Paradox - the more similar two options, the harder to choose between them, though the choosing matters less
- 6 - Insight and Introspection
    - multi-layered perceptrons
    - why you can't "debug" your brain - you can't isolate processes or blocks of memory within your mind, it doesn't seem to work like that
    - time & speed - we're very lucky that people's brains all seem to work at the same pace
    - communication
        - our mental agents can't talk to one another - they can only reference pointers to common networks of signals & symbols
- 7 - Problems and Goals
    - "Intelligence" is our word for processes not yet triviallized by our internal neurochemistry - similarly to how all tech is AI until it's done, then it's simple algorithms
    - __"expert" knowledge is deep and narrow; "common" sense is broad and shallow, which is harder for machines__
        - this may be because new symbols are required for wide knowledge, but deep knowledge requires less symbols 1with more complex weights between them?
    - the puzzle princie: computers can solve any problem, given they have the ability to tell when it's been solved (even better if they can tell they're getting closer to solving it)
    - Reinforcement learning: origins from pavlov & skinner
        - once "rewarded", a procedure of subroutines becomes more able to work together, and less likely to diverge from its configuration (backpropogation)
    - radio sales: global v. local responsibilities. locals work better if available
        - local rewarding requires understaindng of how sub-agents contributed to the global reward, more granular logging 
- 8 - A Theory of Memory
    - K-lines theory: knowledge lines that touch every activated agent for a task
