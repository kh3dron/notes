### GLOSSARY FOR ALL ML TERMS


- Auoregressive Model
- Catastrophic Forgetting
- Cloze task: ommitting certain words and having to fill them in with context
- Curiosity Learning
- Feedforward Neural Network: FNN. Nodes and connections do not form cycles. Mental image of a NN. 
- LM: Language model
- LSTM: long short term memory 
- RNN: recurrent Neural Network, can form cycles unlike FNNs or MLPs
- SOTA: state of the art
- Transformers
- Max Pooling: typically for image processing. grab max of a range (2x2 pixel cells) and compress to single picel of max value (downscale, exagerate features)
- Multilayer Perceptron: "vanilla" neural networks, feedforward NNs. also called MLP
- Zero Shot Learning: making predictions on data never seen before (seen 0 times), see also 1 shot learning
