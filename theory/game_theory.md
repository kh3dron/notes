Game Theoretic Termss

The Basic Terminology of Gamae Theory

- Strategic Interdependence: my strategy depends on your strategy
- Infinite Regress: the problem that comes from strategic interdependence: recusrive logic with no base case. 
- Rational Actors, our kind of people. They do two important things:
    - They have Preferences, which can be ranked. 
    - They don't have preference rankings with negative weight cycles. 
- Theory of Mind: the ability to model someone else's preferences. 
    - This is something that humans do better than other animals - perhaps why we make such great cars. 

Extensive Form Games

- The "decision tree" form of describing a game. 
- Some nuances of notation:
    - Nodes "belong" to whoever is making the current decision
    - Sets of common knowledge points are boxed together, and sometimes treated as a single node when appropriate
- Each player has a Set of strategies

Strategies for Solving Games

- Dominance: very handy. If, in all scenarios, stragety A returns higher score than strategy B, it is strictly dominant. 
    - If A beats OR ties B, then it is weakly dominant
    - If a strategy strictly dominates all other strategies, then it is THE dominant strategy. 
- Iterated Deletion of Strictly Dominated Strategies: since no rational actor will choose to play a dominated strategy, some simple games can be solved by removing those and leaving players with less options. 

The Nash Equilibria 

- The Nash: a point which is bad for unilateral variance. 
    - If you don't think anyone else is defecting, you should't defect either. 
        - It may be possible that if multiple people defect at once, you have a better option - but you do not want to be the first to flip. 
- Prisoner's Dillema type games: get people to choose the same strategies
- Coordination type games: get people to choose different strategies 
- A Nash may call for playing a weakly dominated strategy.
