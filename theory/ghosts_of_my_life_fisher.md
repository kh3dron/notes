Mark Fisher - Ghosts of my Life


- 0: The Slow Cancellation of the Future
     - a sense of newness is missing from the present, which used to be more prevalent
          - my instinct as a tech bro is to disagree, but I will withold judgement
     - things from 20 years ago today are less different than things from 20 years ago in the 80's
     - the past is increasingly commoditized and used as a style, rather than replaced

     - the past does not dissapear anymore

     - "we're trapped in the 20th century - the 21st century is to have 20th century culture on higher definition screens"


     - the reason for this: saturation of neoliberalism into the commoditized arts
          - as artistic creation becomes a business, rather than experimentation, it evolves to reward art that is profitable rather than new
          - this has the effect of slowing the creation of new, era- and genre-defining works and themes

- 1 - Return to the 70's
     - 70's are described as the transition periof for all this - the setup for 80's neoliberalism (reagan / thatcher), and the end of the 60's 
     - really loves Joy Division   
     - the stain of place
          - part of our nostalgia for the past comes from our dissatisfaction with the present - an escapist feedback loop
               - this is present in art

- 2 - Hauntology
     - the term coined by spectres of marx

     - Capitalist Realism
        - capitalism saturates all aspects of life 



- Capitalist Realism
     - 1989: Capitalism loses its most visible opponents
     - "it is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism"
     - capitalism is the new (and also the old) imperialism
     - the individual has been commoditized, has become a spectacle, a product - nihilism is a natural place to go from here
     - even dissent to capitalism is commoditized - slactivism, or thinking you know what's happening counting as fighting reality 

     - Fordism: of Henry Ford
          - industrial manufacturing jobs - repetetive
          - the background where marxist critique evolved
     - Post-fordism
          - flexibility, adaptability is rewarded - more gig-like
          - permiation of capital through education system

     - Advice?
          - don't underestimate capitalism
               - it might die because it kills all the capitalists itself first
          - capitalism is the artificial reality
          - new inclusive politics
