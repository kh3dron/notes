# Atomic Habits - James Clear

**Pros:** There's two or three points in the book that are genuinely perspective changing (such as, thinking in terms of creating an identity rather than a habit) which make it worthwhile. 

**Cons:** This is a perfect example of a "twitter book." There's basically about 10 pages of dense content that's been inflated to 200 pages of anecdotes, stories, repetition, large text, more repetition, and stating of common sense. DO NOT read this book cover to cover, skim it. I hate this style of writing, but it's fine if you know how to handle it. You can watch the guy's ted talk on 3x speed and get all the information here in about 4 minutes. 

**Rate**: 2/10, some good ideas but I hate twitter books

## 1 - The surprising power of atomic habits

- "The aggregation of marginal gains" - habits are an instance of compound interest
- "Plateu of latent potential" - the window of time before results appear. Past this point, things become natural to maintain, but failure happens in this region
- "Forget about goals, focus on systems instead"
  - Prevailing wisdom is specific, actionable goals
  - Problem #1 - winners and losers have the same goals; goal setting has survivorship bias, which is often lower when looking at systems of behavior
  - Problem #2 - goals are temporary, 1-time hits 
  - Problem #3 - goals delay gratification 
  - Problem #4 - goals specify an end
    - setting goals is for winning a game; you are likely more interested in playing the game for longer  
- "you do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems"

## 2 - How your Habits Shape your Identity

- Three layers of behavioral change:
  - Outcomes: goals tend to lie here - "what you get"
  - Processes: regular behavior, habits - "what you do"
  - Identity: self image - "what you believe"
- It is more productive to start from the bottom and work up, than from the top to the bottom
  - **Consider the effect of rejecting a cigarette with "No, I'm trying to quit" v. "No, I don't smoke" (damn)**
  - This is effectively a way to *weaponize pride*
  - The goal is not to read a book, but become a reader / work out -> become an athlete
- A two-step process: decide the type of person you want to be, then prove it to yourself with small wins

## 3 - 4 Steps for Building Better Habits

- As habits are created, brain activity decreases - habits are shorthand for complex activity
- Will habits make your life boring? No. Consider that DISCIPLINE EQUALS FREEDOM
- 4 Steps:
  - Cue - suggests the behavior
  - Craving - more complex thought of the desire
  - Response - action
  - Reward - feelsgoodman

## 4 - The Man who Didn't Look Right

- Eventually, habits become invisible to us
- Make an effort to notice them 

## 5 - The Best Way to Start a New Habit

- Implementation intention - making a plan of action
  - Think of phone bankers asking not "are you going to vote?" but instead "do you know where you will vote?"
- People think they lack motivation, but instead they lack clarity
- "Habit stacking" - use momentum of making one change to influence others, lifestyle inflation

## 6 - Motivation is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More

- Want to eat better? Don't have shitty food in your house
- Set up cues such that you'll encounter them - manage your environment

## 7 - The Secret to Self-Control

## 9 - The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping your Habits

- Three groups that people imitate: the close, the many, and the powerful

## 10 - Finding and Fixing the Causes of your Bad Habits

- Understand why you have said bad habits

## 11 - Walk Slowly, but Never Backward

- Quantity often matters more than quality of practice
- There's a difference between preparing for action and taking it
- Think not about how long it takes to form a habit, but how many repetitions it takes

## 12 - The Law of Least Effort

- People will do things that are easy
- Make things you want to do easy, and things you don't want to do more difficult

## 13 - The Two Minute Rule

- Decisive moments - momentary decisions which define longer periods of time (IE, leaving for the gym or not)
- Two minute rule: find a version of your habit that takes 2 minutes
- "Learn the skill of showing up"

## 14 - Making Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible

- Automate shit

## 15 - The Cardinal Rule of Behavior change

- Try to pull rewards from the future into the present
  - our old friend hyperbolic discounting

## 16 - Sticking with Good Habits Every Day

- Don't break the chain
- If you do? Don't miss twice
- Make sure you're tracking something that actually correlates to the desired behavior
  - "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to become a good measure"

## 17 - Accountability Partners

- put the launch codes into a volunteer
- Use social pressure to your advantage

## 18 - The Truth about Talent

- Play games where the dice are loaded in your favor
- Good questions:
  - What feels like fun to me, but is work for others?
  - What makes me lose track of time?
  - Where do I get greater returns than the average person?
  - What comes naturally to me?

## 19 - The Goldilocks Rule

- "flow state" - things that are not too difficult nor too easy 
- You don't need to be constantly looking for passion, excitement, motivation - you need to be able to handle boredom
- "Professionals stick to the schedule - amateurs let life get in the way"
  - Don't be a "fait-weather meditator"

## 20 - The Downside of Creating Good Habits

- Don't let habituation stop progress
- "mastering a skill v. mastering a field"
- Document hits and misses: be constantly evaluating 
- Don't cling too hard to an identity - you will need to move past it
