The Society of Mind

- 1 - Prologue
    - some terminology:
        - each mind has many smaller processes called agents
        - agents are simple
    - Three rough scales of brain evolution:
        - Short term: maturation of a single brain (through life and learning)
        - Medium term: evolutions of societies (culture, invention)
        - Long term: natural selection (chemistry, anatomy)
    - consider the cell as a unit of life
        - all higher-order organisms appear remarkable compared to the ability of a single cell
    - now, make an equivalent comparison from the basis as one brain as the unit of intelligence 
    - your person is a society of mental subroutines, agents, for different actitons & methods
    - learaned experience gets compressed into "common sense" over time
    - agents are recursive: they are composed of pointers to other, simpler agents
    - *** no agent views itself as intelligent, because it knows all it does is maniuplate other agents. In reality, this is the very process of intelligence.**
- 2 - Wholes and Parts
    - The intelligence of an agent is its ability to form logical conections of its subagents - the weights of the neural network
    - no box can hold a mouse: no board can hold a mouse, and a box is only multiple boards
- 3 - Comflict and Compromise
    - play with blocks: build tower or destroy tower?
    - confusion beteween routines manifests confusion within the parent method of play with blocks
    - The Principle of Noncompromise: the longer a conflict persists amond an agent's subordintaes, the weaker that agent becomes among its own competitors. If this persists, other agents will take control and dismiss the arguing sub-agents. 
    - Heirarchies: "beurocratic" work of organizing subroutines is extremely important
- 4 - The Self
    - can machines have souls? Can machines learn?
    - knowinig the purpose of things makes understaanding them easier - that the heart is aa pump, for examaple
    - we ask a similar function for the Self
        - one function of our Self is to help facilitate long term planning via an identity
        - imagination similarly helps planning
        - sometimes there are secondary goals: we can make ourselves less sleepy by imagining a scenario that makes us mad
- 5 - Individuality
    - The recursive problem of knowing the self - who makes our decisions?
    - Fredkin's Paradox - the more similar two options, the harder to choose between them, though the choosing matters less
- 6 - Insight and Introspection
