The Society of Mind

- 1: Prologue
    - some terminology:
        - each mind has many smaller processes called agents
        - agents are simple
- 1.1 - The Agents of the Mind
    - Three rough scales of brain evolution:
        - Short term: maturation of a single brain (through life and learning)
        - Medium term: evolutions of societies (culture, invention)
        - Long term: natural selection (chemistry, anatomy)
- 1.2 - The Mind and the Brain
    - consider the cell as a unit of life
        - all higher-order organisms appear remarkable compared to the ability of a single cell
    - now, make an equivalent comparison from the basis as one brain as the unit of intelligence
    - agents in the mind, like subroutines for simple functions
