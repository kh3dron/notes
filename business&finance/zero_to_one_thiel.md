- Preface
    - copying thigns that already exist is going from n to n+1. Doing something new is going 0 to 1
    - technology is great
- 1 - The Challenge of the Future
    - What important truth do very few people agree with you on?
    - Out v. up, horizontal v. vertical, extensive v. intensive progress: more versus new
    - Startup thinking
        - beurocratic / large companies reward you for looking busy; this is harder in startups
            - do not completely agree with this - VC money chasing stories of hypergrowth feels like a counter
- 2 - Party Like It's 1999
    - things people  learned from the dot com crash:
        - make incremental advances
        - stay lean and flexible
            - iteration over planning
        - improve on the competition
            - hard to invent something completely new
        - focus on product, not sales
- 3 - All Happy Companies are Different
    - you have to both create value as well as capture it
        - example: airlines create but struggle to capture, google creates less but captures far more
    - "Competition is for losers"
        - monopolies pretend they're competetive, competitors pretend they're the monopolists
        - competitiors frame their markets as intersections of small markets, making them the only ones there
        - monopolists frame with unions of sets, which makes the market huge
    - very hard to have a comfortable / secure workplace without being a monopoly
- 4 - The Ideology of Competition
    - All Rhodes Scholars had a great future in their past
- 5 - Last Mover Advantage
    - Most of a tech company's value comes 10-15 years in the future. Therfore, a critical part of your valuation should be determining why and how you'll still exist 10 years from now. 
    - Characteristics of Monopoly:
        - proprietary technology
            - being a factor of 10 better is sexy and noticable
        - network effects
        - economies of scale
        - branding
    - start small: dominate one market, then move to the next
    - "disruption": stop caring about being seen as defeating incumbents, just build something
- 6 - You are Not a Lottery Ticket
    - Indefinite process: lack plans, build portfolio of options
        - think college apps
        - optimism: "ride the wave", consulting, investing, allocation & organization
    - definite process: favors conviction. become a monopoly of one
        - optimism: build the future, don't wait for it
    - Our Indefinite World
        - Finance: for people who don't actually know how to build things
            - money is perfectly indefinite; it's more valuable than anything you could do with it
        - Politics: preference for incremental, recurring solutions rather than architecting large projects (social security > moon landings)
    - Progress without planning is evolution - trendy, but thiel does not believe always true
    - We must believe in personal agency and control 
- 7 - Follow the Money
    - vc funding has extremely high variance returns
        - tech startups either moon or die, there's no treading water on a >10yr timescale
        - every company in a vc fund must have the potential to absolutely blow the fuck up 
- 8 - Secrets
    - common knowledge - already known. mysteries - unknowable 
    - secrets: solvable but difficult problems
- 9 - Foundations
    - pick your cofounders carefully
    - get everyone on the bus: no part time team members for startups
    - leadership should not be paid crazy high 
    - comp via shares alligns incentives better than cash 
- 10 - The Mechanics of the Mafia
    - playful tech offices should be a side effect, not a goal
    - the paypal mafia are all frens <3 <3 <3
    - what should motivate new hires?
        - money, prestige, smart coworkers, and mission are all table stakes by now (2014)
        - get specific 
        - you cannot win the perk war as a startup
    - simplify people's responsibilities
- 11 - If You Build It, Will They Come?
    - you are not immune to advertising, bitch
    - it's hard work to make marketing look easy
- 12 - Man and Machine
    - man-machine symbiosis has alaways been more real than machine supremacy (kasparov talk)
    - pipelines and UIs to aid human work is where best opertaional leverage exists
    - On strong AI: "replacement by computers is a worry for the 22nd century"
- 13 - Seeing Green
    - Why did cleantech fail in the 2000s?
        - not enough breakthrough tech, too much incremental improving
        - not the right time
        - not starting with big share of small market
        - wrong team
        - distribution problems
        - durability problems
        - no unique opportunity
