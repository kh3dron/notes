- Preface
    - copying thigns that already exist is going from n to n+1. Doing something new is going 0 to 1
    - technology is great
- 1 - The Challenge of the Future
    - What important truth do very few people agree with you on?
    - Out v. up, horizontal v. vertical, extensive v. intensive progress: more versus new
    - Startup thinking
        - beurocratic / large companies reward you for looking busy; this is harder in startups
            - do not completely agree with this - VC money chasing stories of hypergrowth feels like a counter
- 2 - Party Like It's 1999
    - things people  learned from the dot com crash:
        - make incremental advances
        - stay lean and flexible
            - iteration over planning
        - improve on the competition
            - hard to invent something completely new
        - focus on product, not sales
- 3 - All Happy Companies are Different
    - you have to both create value as well as capture it
        - example: airlines create but struggle to capture, google creates less but captures far more
    - "Competition is for losers"
        - monopolies pretend they're competetive, competitors pretend they're the monopolists
        - competitiors frame their markets as intersections of small markets, making them the only ones there
        - monopolists frame with unions of sets, which makes the market huge
    - very hard to have a comfortable / secure workplace without being a monopoly
- 4 - The Ideology of Competition
    - All Rhodes Scholars had a great future in their past
- 5 - Last Mover Advantage
    - Most of a tech company's value comes 10-15 years in the future. Therfore, a critical part of your valuation should be determining why and how you'll still exist 10 years from now. 
    - Characteristics of Monopoly:
        - proprietary technology
            - being a factor of 10 better is sexy and noticable
        - network effects
        - economies of scale
        - branding
