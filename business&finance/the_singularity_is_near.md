2 - A Theory of Technological Evolution

- What is Complexity?
    - The internal structure of a rock - very complex, but not meaningful? 
    - The digits of pi - complex, meningful? 
    - a repetetive document - can be compressed by indicating the repetitions. Is there a bottom limit to compression? 
    
One definition is the amount of Meaningful, Non-random, but Unpredictable information needed to describe something. 
Note that evolutionary processes tend to produce incraesed complexity (biological and computer design). This is a side effect of solving the problem at hand, IE survive to the next generation, but it's a very consistent intermediary goal. 

Order: information that serves a purpose. 
Order is evaluated against a fitness function - a highly ordered solution is fit. Order is not correlated to quantity of information. 

The evolutionary change that moved the thumb down the hand of primates for better grip strenght: little new information, but much more order for the fitness function of survival and propogation. Fractals and probabalistic fractals: the best way to store order in little information. 

Evolution forces incraesed order, which tends to increase complexity. Evolution increases exponentially because ordered states are more able to create more order (this is a circular definition, but I get the point)

Since we use technology to develop further technology, growth is exponential. This will continue until machine intelligence is indistringuishable from human intelligence. In the same way that oceans facilitated the construction of cells, intelligent software and tools facilitate the emergence of intelligence.

"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unraesonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unrasonable man." _George Bernard Shaw, "Maxims for revolutionists"
