- Introduction
    - Electricity is more fundamental to civilization than even computers - take that techies
    - The Grid: the largest machine ever made
    - Every electrical device survives only as long as it can return to the grid
    - There's three grids in the US: west (+ some canada and mexico), east, and texas
    - USA has the highest number of outage minutes per year for aany developed nation
    - What makes green energy complicated?
        - It's less consistent than predictable "stock resource" power plants. The grid infrastructure has been built around this predictability since its inception
        - It is often generated far away from where people live - you have to account for moving electricity over space, which you don't neede to do much when you build a coal plant near a city
        - Decentralized utilities: the grid is build asymetrically (like a symetric internet connection) - you can't just "upload power" with no issues

- 1: The Way of Wind
    - Peaker Plants: the most inefficient, dirty power plants on the grid
    - "60% of the men who run the power grid are within 5 years of retirement" fuck
        - the nataural monopoly of energy generation is a cultural phenomenon - there's been little competetive need to innovate for a while
    - Grid scale energy storage does not exist
        - power is "fresh" - it was generated seconds ago
    - On how electricity flows: it doesn't "flow" like a liquid. It moves to paths of lower resistance
        - toaster example: when you turn a toaster on, it has a lower resistance than the rest of the grid, hence its powered on state
            - obviously some nuance here so you don't get full grid voltage in your kitchen
    - Salmon run problem: excess power is hard to deal with 
        - can't flush the dams or you kill all the local fish 
    - "Though I will concentrate largely on infrastructural delicacy in this book, it does the reader well to remember that the vulnerability of the grid as a technological system is intimately linked to the fragility of biological systems (like salmon runs), the intractability of legal and bureaucratic systems (like the endangered species act), and the unpredictably of meteorological systems (like wind storms)"
    - Wind turbine specs:
        - Largest offshore turbines are 8MW
        - Germany's Enercon makes 7.5 MW models, because they can feed into larger cables
        - US turbines are 1.5-2 MW: 1.5 is as tall as statue of liberty
        - 5 MW turbine is 443 ft tall, 2x statue of liberty
    - Quick laundry list of grid fixes needed:
        - curb customer demand
        - end peak demand
        - grid-scale storage
        - nataionwide extra-HV DC/AC transmission network for overflow
        - reduce line congestion
        - encourage interregional cooperation
        - develop interoperability standards
        - increase government investment
        - train new generation of grid operators
        - integrate a large number of EVs
    - mild issue with home solar: the grid needs revenue from power sales to do grid maintenance. Home solar hookups still use the grid, but can be bad economically

- 2: How the Grid Got its Wires
    - first grid build in san francisco, 1879
    - design history very reminiscent of the internet - everyone piling new shit on top of old, never making sure that the old would work as a good foundation
        - reminds me of the state of infosec
    - Mining was a big customer of power at first; lighting, then pumps and hoists for more productivity
    - Edison's majro contribution: parallel circuits 
        - his first public grids were simple, enormous parallel circuits of bulbs
    - A note on water generation: west coast mountain runoff streams are  extremely consistent, wheras midwestern and east coast rivers are a function of rainfall and are more sporadic
    - Consistent voltage is extremely important to the funciton of the grid
        - At first, this was solved by creating multiple distinct grids with seperate voltages
    - We think of the pwoer grid as a public utility now only because it became that way slowly, over time - it wasn't always
    - DC power doesn't scale well over long distnaces - AC was better for that
        - not much of a concern, just build more power plants
    - Rural Electrification Act of 1936 

- 3: The Consolidation of Power
    - 1882: Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust is born
    - Electricity was a hard business to be in:
        - can't be stored or stockpiled
        - dangerous to maniuplate 
        - can't be seperated from infrastructure

- 4: The Cardigan Path
    - 1977: Jimmy Carter tells americans to turn down their thermostats
        - in the midst of the energy crisis
        - 1979: carter puts solar panels on the white house roof
    - Carter passes the PURPA, public utilities regulatory poliicies act
        - contains an important component: utilties have to buy excess power 
        - Monopsoly: a single BUYER controlling a market
    - 1979: Three Mile Island accident
    - Energy historian Richard Hirsch: Energy jobs attracted the bottom of engineering students. Aerospace, electronics, and computing grabs the best, resulting in a stagnant sector
    - The problem with power plant efficiency: they are only barely proofitable if run at 100% load, 24/7. Uptime is critical 
    - PURPA opened the energy market up for more producers: led to a big jump in alternative power

- 5: Things Fall Apart
    - There isn't much planning put into upgrading energy infrastructure; things work until they break, like most people's cars


- Portland Power Generation:
    - Wind: ~1GW over 3 plants
    - Hydro: ~200MW over 5 plants
    - Solar: 46MW over "various projects"
    - Natural Gas / Oil: 2GWh over 5 plants
